# *Break Free from Dependency Hell with Docker! Containerizing Your Apps for Less Headaches.*

We've all heard the time-honored excuse at some point,
"It works on my machine".
Nothing is worse than trying to run code that you developed on your laptop on the production server, 
and it just does. not. behave. Whether you are met with undefined
behavior or, even worse, the app won't even run, 
portability has been a problem plaguing development for years.
 However, thanks to the miracles of 
modern science, there exists a panacea: containerization! 
In this workshop, join me to learn about how to utilize Docker
containers to isolate your applications and make sure they launch smoothly wherever you want to run them!

This repository contains all info relevant to the workshop, as well as the code used in the presentation.
